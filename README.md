## Migration from JavaScript to TypeScript

This version of PitLane Manager represents a migration from a previous JavaScript-based project. The migration was undertaken to leverage the benefits of TypeScript, enhancing code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity. TypeScript provides static typing, enabling early error detection and improved editor support, which are crucial for managing large-scale applications effectively.
